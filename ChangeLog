2000-02-23  thebard
		Profiling cruff.

2000-02-22  thebard
		Added note about compilation options.

		Just added a superflous __inline before getbits. It looks like
		gcc is already auto inlining getbits with -O3 or higher. This
		is jsut forcing it to on other compilers, or if gcc is being
		stupid.

		Update the Recomended compile opts.

2000-02-22  menno
		Restored PNS quality

		Fixed WIN32 compilation

2000-02-21  lenox

2000-02-20  thebard
		Added a note regarding the XMMS aac plugin, and that you MUST use the cvs
		version of the plugin to get things to work correctly.

		Initial work on profiling. I think I can squeeze more speed. 
		Started a profiling log so we can chart the speed increases.

		Our first speedup. 5.12%.

		More profiling tweakings. Not much exciting.

		 Macroized getbits. It was slower than gcc's automatic inlining
		of getbits. If I explictly inline getbits its the same as if
		gcc inlined it. Go figure. Anyways, I think get bits is a lost
		cause, unless we inline asm it. Even with assembly its not
		gonna speed up alot. looking at the .s files, it looks like the
		compiler is already doing a pretty good job. We need to figure
		out how to do getbits more than jsut one at a whack.

2000-02-19  lenox
		removed 2048 and 256 FFT

		fixed calculation of playing length in plugin

2000-02-19  thebard
		Added -w for writing to stdout. It works, but there is a bit of static
		at teh beginning and end as the printf's of version and such are adding
		garbage into the the stdout. I'll fix it shortly.

		Ripped out all the \r's so that things print correctly on unix
		boxen.

		Reorganized so that there is no output except the raw wav data when -w is
		on the command line.

2000-02-19  oxygene
