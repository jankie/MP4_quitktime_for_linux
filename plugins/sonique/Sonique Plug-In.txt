
Sonique AAC Plug-In
===================

By Nic


Version 1.5
-----------

Is now compatible with faad1.5


Acknowledgements:
Menno, Rage, Tony, et al - for more than obvious reasons
Ivan Dimkovic - for just as obvious a reason

McCann at the Sonique Team - Thanx for letting me nag you
Jack Moffit (iCast) - for helping me chase the Sonique Team.


Installation
------------
Compile by loading sonique.dsp into Visual C++ v6
the compiled file is aac.sqp
copy this to your sonique (should be version 1.9!) system directory
i.e. c:\sonique\system

If after attempting to fail try compiling using a different setting (i.e. release or debug)
- both work on mine fine - but i know that there could be problems with either release or debug (it is due to the run-time library - i.e. preferences->c/c++->code generation)


Bugs
----

Hmmm.......probably needs lots of testing send all bugs and how to replicate them to:
nic@vampirehunter.com

and I will fix them ASAP - dont bother Menno with them as he shouldn't have to answer to
my rushed coding!
